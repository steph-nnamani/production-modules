This module is specifically for deploying the "Hello, World" app, which uses the asg-rolling-deploy and alb modules under the hood. 

The data "terraform_remote_state" "db" block is used to fetch outputs from another Terraform state file stored in an S3 bucket. This is a common pattern for sharing data between different Terraform configurations.

In this case, it's retrieving database connection information (address and port) from a separate Terraform state that manages your database infrastructure. This allows your application module to reference the database without having to hardcode the connection details.

The block specifies:

backend = "s3" - Indicates that the state file is stored in an S3 bucket

config - Contains the configuration for accessing the state file:

bucket - The name of the S3 bucket where the state file is stored

key - The path within the bucket to the state file

region - The AWS region where the S3 bucket is located

This data source is then used in your user_data template to provide the database connection information to your application:

user_data = templatefile("${path.module}/user-data.sh", {
  server_port = var.server_port
  db_address  = data.terraform_remote_state.db.outputs.address
  db_port     = data.terraform_remote_state.db.outputs.port
  server_text = var.server_text
})

This approach allows you to maintain separation of concerns between your database and application infrastructure while still allowing them to reference each other.

Explanation:
============
Here Terraform's templatefile() function is used to:

    Load a template file: "${path.module}/user-data.sh" - This loads the user-data.sh script from the current module's directory

    Pass variables to the template: The second parameter { starts a map of variables that will be substituted into the template

    Dynamic path resolution: ${path.module} ensures Terraform looks for the file in the module's directory (not the root directory where you run terraform)

What this does:
----------------

Takes the user-data.sh shell script template

Replaces placeholders in the script with actual values (like ${server_port}, ${db_address}, etc.)

Returns the processed script as a string

This processed script becomes the user_data that gets executed when EC2 instances launch

# How Module Variables Work:
When you call a module, you only need to declare variables in your calling module (hello-world-app) if:

You want to expose them to users of your hello-world-app module

You need to pass different values than the ASG module's defaults

The ASG module variable has no default (making it required)
